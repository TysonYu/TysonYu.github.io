I am a Researcher at Huawei. I earned my Ph.D. from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I was supervised by [Prof. Pascale Fung](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk). I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn). 

My research focuses on developing more reliable and practical large language models (LLMs) tailored for real-world deployment scenarios. Currently, my work spans three core directions: 
+ LLM post-training
+ Comprehensive LLM evaluation
+ Coding agent development

For detailed information on my publications and research outputs, please refer to my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JK7nNekAAAAJ). Should you have any inquiries or wish to collaborate, feel free to contact me at tyuah@connect.ust.hk.
