A new comprehensive survey introduces Agent-as-a-Judge, an advanced AI evaluation paradigm that leverages planning, tool integration, multi-agent collaboration, and memory to address the biases, lack of verification, and coarse-grained limitations of traditional LLM-as-a-Judge, with applications spanning general domains like math and fact-checking to professional fields such as medicine, law, and education. The survey outlines the evolution of Agent-as-a-Judge into three stages (Procedural, Reactive, Self-Evolving), analyzes core methodologies and key challenges including computational cost and safety, and points to future directions like personalization and interactivity to unlock truly autonomous AI evaluation.
